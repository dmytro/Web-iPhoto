TO-DO:

Look
----------
* Full "screen" mode (hide navigation panels)
* Hide/show controls depending on mode
* Events. Event are not stored in SQLite, only XML in iPhoto 8.1.
* Background setting black-white

* Onscreen keystrokes help

* Long album names wrap into next line - cut names o fit panel

* add CSS for iPhone (whole new sub-project?)



Navigation
----------
* Navigation in album thumbs mode is inconsistent: click on albums shows 
  album photo thummbs, click on flders: does nothing.
* Keys navigation in left side panel:

  - left/right key on folder should close/expand folder instead on
    moving up down

  - when folder is highligted in left panel: all abums in the folder
    should become selected.


Controls:
----------
 * Slideshow controls: stop, pause, forward, speed selection
 * On-screen controls (transparent auto-hide) for slideshows 
   and "full-screen" mode
 * Thumb size 
 * Next/Prev buttons in albumThumb mode
 
FIX:

* Remove ugly references up "../" for all photos and thumbnails. Now
  index.html is located in wiphoto/ dir, so need to go upo one
  directory for imgage URL. Ugly.

Installation
------------
* chmod on directories with photos and all under wiphoto.
When run wiphoto from web server need to set peromititons on
directories, so that wiphoto data and photo files are readable by web
server. This is a secutory issue as need to make all files world
readdable. Need to find better solution.
 chmod a+rx -R wiphoto/
 chmod a+rx -R Data
 chmod a+rx Data
 chmod a+rx -R Data
 chmod a+rx -R Modified/


* What's the difference between Data and Data.noindex? Din not work on
  another installation of iPhoto, where Data wa not directory but file
  with path to Data.noindex in it. Fixed by remowing  Data.noindex file
  and creating symlink.

Done
-----
* Nestes albums [as of v0.2]
* Paging for large albums - photo album with ~500 photos generates
  'Slow script' warning. (done 7/12/'09)
* Slide-show - done, 
* toggle() (slideshow pause/continue) -- done 7/12/'09
